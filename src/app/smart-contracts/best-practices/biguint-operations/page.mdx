# BigUint Operations Demystified

In the realm of `BigUint` operations, it's crucial to understand that a `BigUint` is essentially a handle, akin to how system file handles operate. It's essentially a struct with an `i32` member representing the handle. All operations must be carried out through API functions by passing handles for the result, the first operand, and the second operand. Leveraging Rust's operator overloading feature, we can redefine arithmetic operators, making it convenient to add `BigUint` values, much like primitive number types.

However, you may encounter scenarios where you need to use the same number multiple times. Consider having four `BigUint` values: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and you want to perform the following operations:

```rust
c = a + b;
d = c + a;
```

You'll quickly realize that this doesn't work due to Rust's ownership system. After the first operation, `a` is consumed, and you're likely to encounter an error like this:

```rust
move occurs because `a` has type `<Self as ContractBase>::BigUint`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
```

The simplest solution is to clone `a`:

```rust
c = a.clone() + b;
d = c + a;
```

Although the errors are now resolved, behind the scenes, this involves more than just copying the handle. `a.clone()` creates an entirely new `BigUint`, copying the bytes from the original `a`.

A more efficient approach is to borrow `a`. `+` and other operations are defined for references of `BigUint`, so you can rewrite it as follows:

```rust
c = &a + &b;
d = c + a;
```

Another situation where you can avoid creating additional `BigUint` instances is when performing operations with multiple arguments:

```rust
e = a + b + c + d;
```

Or, if you prefer to keep the instances (you can't add an owned `BigUint` to `&BigUint`, so you must also borrow the results):

```rust
e = &((&(&a + &b) + &c) + &d);
```

In both cases, the underlying API calls are as follows:

```rust
temp1 = bigIntNew();
bigIntAdd(temp1, a, b);

temp2 = bigIntNew();
bigIntAdd(temp2, temp1, c);

temp3 = bigIntNew();
bigIntAdd(temp3, temp2, d);
```

This results in creating three new `BigUint` instancesâ€”one for the result of `a + b`, one for `(a + b) + c`, and one for the final result that ends up in `e`. You can optimize this by rewriting the code as follows:

```rust
e = BigUint::zero();
e += &a;
e += &b;
e += &c;
e += &d;
```

This approach creates a single `BigUint` instead of three.

While these examples may seem straightforward, they provide clarity on how `BigUint` operations work and how to maximize their efficiency.
