## How to Set a Contract Name

Setting a contract name is an important practice for better identification and management of your smart contracts on the Klever Blockchain.

## Step 1: Add the Name Change Endpoint

Add this endpoint to your contract:

```rust
#[only_owner]
#[endpoint(changeContractName)]
fn change_contract_name(&self, new_name: ManagedBuffer) {
    self.send().set_account_name(new_name);
}
```

**NOTE**: If your contract is already deployed, you will need to upgrade your contract to include this new endpoint. You can learn how to upgrade your contract [here](/smart-contracts/reference/upgrading#how-to-upgrade-a-smart-contract).

## Step 2: Set the Contract Name

Once the upgrade is complete (or your contract is deployed), you can set the contract name using KleverScan ([mainnet](https://kleverscan.org) or [testnet](https://testnet.kleverscan.org/)).

You will need to invoke the `changeContractName` endpoint with the desired name as an argument.

## Step 3: Verification

After setting the contract name, you can verify it was set correctly by:

### Using Klever Explorer
1. Search for your contract address on Klever Explorer ([mainnet](https://kleverscan.org) or [testnet](https://testnet.kleverscan.org/))
2. Go to your contract page
3. The new contract name should appear at the top of the page
