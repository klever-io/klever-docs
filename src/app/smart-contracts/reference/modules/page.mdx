# Modularization in Smart Contract Development

## Overview

Smart contract modules play a crucial role in structuring contracts into more manageable segments. Their reusability and ability to minimize code repetition make them valuable in contract development.

## Module Creation

You can define modules either within the same crate as the primary contract or in a distinct standalone crate. The latter approach is beneficial for modules intended for use in various contracts.

A module is essentially a trait annotated with the `#[klever_sc::module]` macro, allowing standard smart contract functionalities such as endpoints, events, and storage mappers.

Consider the example of a storage module:

```rust
#[klever_sc::module]
pub trait StorageModule {
    #[view(getQuorum)]
    #[storage_mapper("firstStorage")]
    fn first_storage(&self) -> SingleValueMapper<usize>;

    #[view]
    #[storage_mapper("secondStorage")]
    fn second_storage(&self) -> SingleValueMapper<u64>;
}
```

In your core file, typically `lib.rs`, you should declare the module. For instance, if the storage module's file is `storage.rs`, it's declared as follows:

```rust
pub mod storage;
```

## Integrating a Module

Modules can be included in other modules and contracts alike:

```rust
pub trait SetupModule:
    crate::storage::StorageModule
    + crate::util::UtilModule {

}
```

```rust
#[klever_sc::contract]
pub trait MainContract:
    setup::SetupModule
    + storage::StorageModule
    + util::UtilModule {

}
```

It's important to note that the main contract must implement all the modules used by any sub-modules. In the given example, the `MainContract` must implement `UtilModule` to use `SetupModule`, even if it doesn't directly use `UtilModule`.

## Wrapping Up

Our modular system is designed to streamline the process of writing maintainable and reusable smart contract code.
