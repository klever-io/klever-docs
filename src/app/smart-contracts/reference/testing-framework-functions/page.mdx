# Rust Testing Framework Functions Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the available functions in the Rust Testing Framework, focusing on the functionalities offered by the `BlockchainStateWrapper` type.

## Introduction

This page lists the currently available functions in the Rust Testing Framework, specifically those provided by the `BlockchainStateWrapper` type.

Please note that most functions in this framework use the `num_bigint::BigUint` type for numbers. It is essential to differentiate this type from the `BigUint` type used inside smart contracts, as they are distinct types. It is recommended to use the Rust version outside of lambda functions and only use the managed type when interacting directly with the smart contract.

## State-checking Functions

These functions are designed to check the blockchain state and will cause the test to fail if the check is unsuccessful.

### `check_klv_balance`

```rust
check_klv_balance(&self, address: &Address, expected_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

This function checks the KLV balance for the given address.

### `check_kda_balance`

```rust
check_kda_balance(&self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], expected_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Checks the fungible Kda balance for the specified address.

### `check_nft_balance`

```rust
check_nft_balance<T>(&self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], nonce: u64, expected_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint, opt_expected_attributes: Option<&T>)
```

This function checks the NFT balance for a specific nonce associated with an address and optionally verifies the NFT attributes. If you are only interested in the balance, pass `Option::None` for `opt_expected_attributes`. If the Rust compiler struggles to deduce the generic `T`, you can use one of the following approaches:

```rust
b_mock.check_nft_balance::<Empty>(..., None);

b_mock.check_nft_balance(..., Option::<Empty>::None);
```

## State-getter Functions

These functions retrieve the current state and are generally used after a transaction to verify that tokens have reached their intended destination. Most functions will trigger a panic if an invalid address is provided as an argument.

### `get_klv_balance`

```rust
get_klv_balance(&self, address: &Address) -> num_bigint::BigUint
```

Gets the KLV balance for the specified account.

### `get_kda_balance`

```rust
get_kda_balance(&self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], token_nonce: u64) -> num_bigint::BigUint
```

Retrieves the Kda balance for the specified account. If you are interested in the balance of a fungible token, set `token_nonce` to 0.

### `get_nft_attributes`

```rust
get_nft_attributes<T: TopDecode>(&self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], token_nonce: u64) -> Option<T>
```

Fetches the NFT attributes for a token owned by the specified address. It will return `Option::None` if no attributes are found.

### `dump_state`

```rust
dump_state(&self)
```

Prints the current state to the console, which is useful for debugging.

### `dump_state_for_account_hex_attributes`

```rust
dump_state_for_account_hex_attributes(&self, address: &Address)
```

Similar to the previous function but specifically dumps the state for the given account.

### `dump_state_for_account`

```rust
dump_state_for_account<AttributesType: TopDecode + core::fmt::Debug>(&self, address: &Address)
```

Like the function above, it dumps the state for the specified account but also prints the attributes in a user-friendly format. This is particularly useful for debugging NFT attributes.

## State-altering Functions

These functions modify the state in various ways.

### `create_user_account`

```rust
create_user_account(&mut self, klv_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint) -> Address
```

Creates a new user account with the provided KLV balance. The framework generates a pseudo-random address for this account.

### `create_user_account_fixed_address`

```rust
create_user_account_fixed_address(&mut self, address: &Address, klv_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Similar to the previous function but allows you to create an account with a fixed address when necessary.

### `create_sc_account`

```rust
create_sc_account<CB, ContractObjBuilder>(&mut self, klv_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint, owner: Option<&Address>, obj_builder: ContractObjBuilder, contract_wasm_path: &str) -> ContractObjWrapper<CB, ContractObjBuilder>
```

Creates a smart contract account. The `obj_builder` parameter requires `sc_namespace::contract_obj`. This function returns a `ContractObjWrapper`, which contains the address of the newly created smart contract and the function used to create instances of your contract. If you only need the address for setting the balance, you can use the `address_ref` method to obtain a reference to the stored address. The `contract_wasm_path` is relative to the `tests` folder where the current test file is located.

### `create_sc_account_fixed_address`

```rust
create_sc_account_fixed_address<CB, ContractObjBuilder>(&mut self, address: &Address, klv_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint, owner: Option<&Address>, obj_builder: ContractObjBuilder, contract_wasm_path: &str) -> ContractObjWrapper<CB, ContractObjBuilder>
```

Similar to the previous function, but it allows the caller to specify the address instead of generating a random one.

### `set_klv_balance`

```rust
set_klv_balance(&mut self, address: &Address, balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Sets the KLV balance for the specified account.

### `set_kda_balance`

```rust
set_kda_balance(&mut self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Sets the fungible token balance for the specified account.

### `set_nft_balance`

```rust
set_nft_balance<T: TopEncode>(&mut self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], nonce: u64, balance: &num_bigint::BigUint, attributes: &T)
```

Sets the non-fungible token balance for the specified account along with the associated attributes. Attributes can be of any serializable type. If you do not require attributes, you can pass "empty" using various approaches, such as `&()`, `&Vec::<u8>::new()`, `BoxedBytes::empty()`, etc.

### `set_kda_local_roles`

```rust
set_kda_local_roles(&mut self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], roles: &[KdaLocalRole])
```

Sets the Kda token roles for the specified address and token, typically used during setup steps.

### `set_block_epoch`

```rust
set_block_epoch(&mut self, block_epoch: u64)
```

### `set_block_nonce`

```rust
set_block_nonce(&mut self, block_nonce: u64)
```

### `set_block_round`

```rust
set_block_round(&mut self, block_round: u64)
```

### `set_block_timestamp`

```rust
set_block_timestamp(&mut self, block_timestamp: u64)
```

### `set_block_random_seed`

```rust
set_block_random_seed(&mut self, block_random_seed: Box<[u8; 48]>)
```

These functions allow you to set various values for the current block information.

### `set_prev_block_epoch`

```rust
set_prev_block_epoch(&mut self, block_epoch: u64)
```

### `set_prev_block_nonce`

```rust
set_prev_block_nonce(&mut self, block_nonce: u64)
```

### `set_prev_block_round`

```rust
set_prev_block_round(&mut self, block_round: u64)
```

### `set_prev_block_timestamp`

```rust
set_prev_block_timestamp(&mut self, block_timestamp: u64)
```

### `set_prev_block_random_seed`

```rust
set_prev_block_random_seed(&mut self, block_random_seed: Box<[u8; 48]>)
```

These functions are similar to the previous set but apply to the previous block.

## Smart Contract Execution Functions

These functions facilitate interactions with smart contracts. While they can be categorized as state-altering functions, they have been placed in a separate section for clarity.

### `execute_tx`

```rust
execute_tx(&mut self, caller: &Address, sc_wrapper: &ContractObjWrapper<...>, klv_payment: &num_bigint::BigUint, tx_fn: TxFn) -> TxResult
```

Executes a transaction towards the specified smart contract, optionally including a KLV payment (use 0 for no payment). `tx_fn` is a lambda function that accepts a contract object as an argument. For more details on how to write such a lambda, refer to the [Crowdfunding test examples](/smart-contracts/reference/rust-testing-framework).

### `execute_kda_transfer`

```rust
execute_kda_transfer(&mut self, caller: &Address, sc_wrapper: &ContractObjWrapper<...>, token_id: &[u8], kda_nonce: u64, kda_amount: &num_bigint::BigUint, tx_fn: TxFn) -> TxResult
```

Similar to the previous function but executes an Kda/NFT transfer instead of a KLV transfer.

### `execute_kda_multi_transfer`

```rust
execute_kda_multi_transfer(&mut self, caller: &Address, sc_wrapper: &ContractObjWrapper<...>, kda_transfers: &[TxInputKDA], tx_fn: TxFn) -> TxResult
```

Similar to the function above but performs a MultiKDANFT transfer.

### `execute_query`

```rust
execute_query(&mut self, sc_wrapper: &ContractObjWrapper<...>, query_fn: TxFn) -> TxResult
```

Executes a SCQuery on the smart contract. None of the changes are committed to the state, but the function requires mutability to perform temporary changes. Just like on the real blockchain, there is no caller or token transfer for queries.

### `execute_in_managed_environment`

```rust
execute_in_managed_environment(&self, f: Func) -> T
```

Executes an arbitrary function and returns its result, which can be of any type. This function is rarely used but can be helpful when performing checks involving managed types, which cannot be created outside of lambda functions.

## Undocumented Functions

Several scenario generation functions have not been included in this documentation. We advise against using scenario generation, as it is time-consuming, and the results are often unreadable scenario files. If scenarios are necessary, we recommend writing them manually. If you still wish to explore scenario generation, you can find examples in the [Crowdfunding test examples](/smart-contracts/reference/rust-testing-framework).
