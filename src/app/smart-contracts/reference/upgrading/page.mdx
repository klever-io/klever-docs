## How to Upgrade a Smart Contract

Upgrading a smart contract is quite simple, although the effects might not be very clear. Just run this command to upgrade it:

```
chown -R 999 .
docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/opt/klever-blockchain \
    --network=host \
    --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/operator \
    kleverapp/klever-go:latest  --key-file=KEY_FILE \
    sc upgrade SC_ADDRESS --wasm=WASM_PATH \
     --args example --payable --payableBySC --readable --upgradeable
```

Replace SC_ADDRESS, KEY_FILE and WASM_PATH accordingly. If needs arguments, add --args VALUE.

Check your flags --payable --payableBySC --readable --upgradeable to make sure they are correct.
