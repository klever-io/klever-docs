# Klever Smart Contracts

The KleverChain Blockchain's virtual machine (KVM) executes [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly). This means that it can execute smart contracts
written in _any programming language_ that can be compiled to WASM bytecode. **Please note that we currently only offer support for Rust, and not any other programming languages at the moment.**

Developers are encouraged to use Rust for their smart contracts, however. Klever provides a [Rust framework](https://github.com/klever-io/klever-vm-sdk-rs)
which allows for unusually clean and efficient code in smart contracts, a rarity in the blockchain field.
A declarative testing framework is bundled as well. For the best coding experience,
developers have the [Klever IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Klever-org.vscode-kvm-ide) at their disposal.

Navigate through the sidebar to see some tutorials to get you started, as well as the Rust framework documentation.
