# Running Scenarios

The Klever smart contract testing infrastructure is designed with scenarios in mind, and there are various ways to execute them. The following diagram illustrates the available options:

To run a scenario, you typically have a JSON scenario file (e.g., `example.scen.json`). There are two main methods for executing scenarios:

1. Using the `run-scenarios` Standalone Tool:

   - The `run-scenarios` tool is part of the VM tooling.
   - You can execute scenarios by running the command `run-scenarios <path>`, where `<path>` can be a specific scenario file or a folder containing multiple scenario files.
   - If you provide a folder path, the tool will run all scenario files with the `.scen.json` extension in that folder.
   - The results are printed to the console.

2. Integration in a Rust Project:

   - To integrate scenario tests into a Rust project and run them as part of your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, you need to write Rust tests that execute the scenarios.
   - The standard project layout includes folders for scenarios, source code (`src`), and contract code (`wasm`).
   - Rust tests for scenarios should be placed in the `tests` folder and named following the convention: `<contract_name>_scenario_go_test.rs` and `<contract_name>_scenario_rs_test.rs` for the Go and Rust backends, respectively.
   - You can use the `#[ignore]` annotation to temporarily skip tests that you don't want to run.

   Example Rust test setup for Go and Rust backends:

   ```rust
   use klever_sc_scenario::*;

   fn world() -> ScenarioWorld {
       ScenarioWorld::vm_go() // For the Go backend
       // OR
       // ScenarioWorld::new() // For the Rust backend
   }

   #[test]
   fn my_contract_go() {
       world().run("scenarios/my_contract.scen.json");
   }

   #[test]
   #[ignore = "Reason to ignore"]
   fn ignored_test_go() {
       world().run("scenarios/ignored_test.scen.json");
   }
   ```

   - It's customary to add a `_go` or `_rs` suffix to the test functions to distinguish between the Go and Rust backends.
   - The `world()` function sets up the testing environment.

### Setting Up the Rust Backend Environment

When using the Rust backend, you may need to set up the testing environment, as shown in the example above. The minimal setup includes the following:

- Setting the current directory from the workspace using `set_current_dir_from_workspace("<contract_crate_relative_path_to_workspace>")`.
- Registering the contract using `register_contract("file:<path_to_binary>", <contract_crate>::ContractBuilder)`. This tells the framework how to deploy or run the contract by specifying its binary path and builder.

The `ContractBuilder` object is generated automatically for each contract by the `#[klever_sc::contract]` procedural macro.

### Auto-generating Boilerplate Code

Writing test functions manually for each scenario can be tedious and error-prone. To simplify this process, you can use the `sc-meta test-gen` tool, which automates the generation of test functions for scenarios. Here's how it works:

- If no `*scenario_go_file.rs` or `*scenario_rs_file.rs` files are found, you can create them automatically using the `--create` flag.
- The tool generates test functions for each scenario in the `scenarios` folder.
- Existing tests with `#[ignore]` annotations or comments are preserved.
- The tool can be called multiple times to update tests when scenarios change.
- It supports generating test functions for multiple contract crates at once.

Here's an example of how to use the `sc-meta test-gen` tool:

```bash
sc-meta test-gen --path <target_directory> --create
```

- `--path`: Specifies the target directory where the tool should search for contract meta crates. The default is the current directory.
- `--ignore`: Allows you to specify directories to ignore. The default is to ignore the `target` directory.
- `--create`: Creates test files if they don't exist.

Using this tool can save you time and ensure that your scenarios are always covered by tests.
