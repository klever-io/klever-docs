# Custom Types

In certain cases, we create new types that require direct serialization and deserialization when interacting with contracts. For `structs` and `enums`, setting up serialization and deserialization is straightforward and requires minimal code.

## Custom Structures

Any structure defined in a contract or library can become serializable by adding one or more of the following annotations: `TopEncode`, `TopDecode`, `NestedEncode`, `NestedDecode`.

**Example implementation:**

```rust
#[derive(TopEncode, TopDecode, NestedEncode, NestedDecode)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    pub int: u16,
    pub seq: Vec<u8>,
    pub another_byte: u8,
    pub uint_32: u32,
    pub uint_64: u64,
}
```

**Top-encoding**: All fields are nested-encoded one after the other.

**Nested encoding**: Similar to top-encoding, where all fields are nested-encoded one after the other.

**Example Value**

```rust
MyStruct {
    int: 0x42,
    seq: vec![0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5],
    another_byte: 0x6,
    uint_32: 0x12345,
    uint_64: 0x123456789,
}
```

This value is encoded (both top-encoding and nested encoding) as: `0x004200000005010203040506000123450000000123456789`.

Explanation:

```
[
/* int */ 0, 0x42,
/* seq length */ 0, 0, 0, 5,
/* seq contents */ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
/* another_byte */ 6,
/* uint_32 */ 0x00, 0x01, 0x23, 0x45,
/* uint_64 */ 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89
]
```

## Custom Enums

Any enum defined in a contract or library can be made serializable by adding one or more of the following annotations: `TopEncode`, `TopDecode`, `NestedEncode`, `NestedDecode`.

**A Simple Enum Example:**

_Example taken from the klever-sc-codec tests._

```rust
#[derive(TopEncode, TopDecode, NestedEncode, NestedDecode)]
enum DayOfWeek {
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday,
    Sunday,
}
```

**A More Complex Enum Example:**

```rust
#[derive(TopEncode, TopDecode, NestedEncode, NestedDecode)]
enum EnumWithEverything {
    Default,
    Today(DayOfWeek),
    Write(Vec<u8>, u16),
    Struct {
        int: u16,
        seq: Vec<u8>,
        another_byte: u8,
        uint_32: u32,
        uint_64: u64,
    },
}
```

**Nested Encoding**:

- First, the discriminant is encoded. The discriminant is the index of the variant, starting with `0`.
- Then the fields in that variant (if any) are nested-encoded one after the other.

**Top-encoding**:

It follows the same rules as nested-encoding, with an additional rule: if the discriminant is `0` (first variant) and there are no fields, nothing is encoded.
