# Code Metadata

## Introduction

Code metadata consists of flags representing the allowed actions of a smart contract after deployment. These flags include:

- `upgradeable` - indicating whether the contract can be upgraded in the future.
- `readable` - determining if the contract's storage can be read by other contracts.
- `payable` - specifying if the contract can receive funds without any endpoint being called, similar to user accounts. Note: A contract does NOT have to be payable to receive funds in payable endpoints.
- `payable by smart contracts` - similar to the `payable` flag but exclusively designed to receive funds from other smart contracts. User transfers will be rejected.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚨 Code metadata **must be specified** at deploy-time, and if the contract is marked as _upgradeable_, it **must also be specified** at upgrade-time. |

| 🚨 **The `#[kda_attribute]` annotation should only be used at the trait level in conjunction with `#[klever_sc::contract]` or `#[klever_sc::module]` annotations. Placing it anywhere else will not work as intended.** |

## Usage

When deploying or upgrading a smart contract using **koperator**, the default _code metadata flags_ are only `upgradeable`. These default values can be overwritten by using the following options with the `koperator sc create` or `koperator sc upgrade` commands:

- `--upgradeable` - marks the contract as **non-** `upgradeable`.
- `--readable` - marks the contract as **non-** `readable`.
- `--payable` - marks the contract as `payable`.
- `--payableBySc` - marks the contract as `payable by smart contracts`.

## Bit-flag Layout

Internally, the metadata is stored as a 2-byte wide bit-flag. For clarity, let's define the flags in binary and hex representation:

```rust
bitflags! {
    struct CodeMetadata: u16 {
		const UPGRADEABLE = 0b0000_0001_0000_0000; // LSB of the first byte
		const READABLE = 0b0000_0100_0000_0000; // 3rd LSB of the first byte
		const PAYABLE = 0b0000_0000_0000_0010; // 2nd LSB of the second byte
		const PAYABLE_BY_SC = 0b0000_0000_0000_0100; // 3rd LSB of the second byte
    }
}
```

Alternatively, in hex representation:

```rust
const UPGRADEABLE: u16 = 0x01_00;
const READABLE: u16 = 0x04_00;
const PAYABLE: u16 = 0x00_02;
const PAYABLE_BY_SC = 0x00_04;
```

For example, if you wish to deploy a contract that is payable and upgradeable, the metadata would be `0x0102`.

## Conclusion

We believe that these flags will significantly simplify the process of creating and upgrading smart contracts.
