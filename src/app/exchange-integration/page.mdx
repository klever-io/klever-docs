# Exchange Integration
Connect your exchange with our Klever Blockchain. For that, you need to deploy a node, integrate it with Klever's blockchain and you may also test this integration.

## Nodes deployment

Deploy a Klever Blockchain node to start the integration with an exchange

The first step to integrating an exchange with our Klever Blockchain is connecting to its network by deploying a Klever Blockchain node.

Running a node will provide a faster and more reliable access to all the chain updates as well as broadcasting transactions onto the blockchain. You can use a third-party node to interact with the blockchain, however.

Refer to [this How to run a node section](/node-operations#how-to-run-a-node) to get started with the node deployment.

## Nodes Integration

To interact with Klever's blockchain, reading, fetching and uploading data, we provide a set of API calls.

There you can find their documentation pages:

[Klever Blockchain Proxy API](https://api.mainnet.klever.org/swagger/index.html)

[Klever Blockchain Node API](https://node.mainnet.klever.org/swagger/index.html)


### Custom integration

**Generate Adresses**

To generate addresses, you may refer to [How to create a wallet session](/node-operations#how-to-create-a-wallet)

**Transfer Assets**

To create transactions, you can [use the endpoints directly](/api-and-sdk#web-sdk), or [use Klever Blockchain SDK](/web-app#quick-start-guide) (if using javascript).

**Read transactions**

To read the recent transactions, you'll need to  [use transaction list endpoint](https://api.mainnet.klever.org/swagger/index.html#/Transaction/get_v1_0_transaction_list),  and use the queries that are relevant for your search (Ex: filter by asset, date, receiver/sender address, etc.)


## Testing

Test the integration with Klever Blockchain

We recommend testing both on testnet, and then on mainnet nodes, before launching and app.

Throughout all the stages of development, you can use the testnet to test the logic of your application and the integration with the chain. The main advantage is that in the testnet you can request test KLV for free.

The mainnet is where the application will be actually running, so it is recommended to test the flow in the production environment as well.
