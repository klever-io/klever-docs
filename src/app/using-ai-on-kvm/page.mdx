# Introduction to AI on KVM

Transform your smart contract development with AI-powered assistance through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI models to connect to external data sources and tools. In Klever smart contract development, MCP provides:

- **Contextual Knowledge**: Access to Klever-specific documentation, patterns, and best practices
- **Real-time Assistance**: Interactive help during development, debugging, and deployment
- **Automated Workflows**: Generation of scripts, tests, and deployment procedures
- **Error Prevention**: Validation against known issues and common mistakes

## What You Can Do with Klever MCP

### **Project Management**
- Initialize complete project structures with `init_klever_project`
- Generate automation scripts (deploy, upgrade, query, interact)
- Set up testnet configurations and development environments

### **Smart Contract Development**
- Create contracts from high-level specifications
- Generate storage mappers, endpoints, and event systems
- Implement complex patterns (Factory, Proxy, Governance)

### **Deployment & Interaction**
- Deploy to testnet with proper configurations
- Generate interaction scripts with correct parameter encoding
- Create query scripts with returnData parsing

## What You'll Learn

- Set up MCP with Claude Code and VS Code
- Master basic MCP functionalities for contract development
- Use project specification templates

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (version 18 or higher)
- Git for cloning repositories
- Basic understanding of smart contract concepts
