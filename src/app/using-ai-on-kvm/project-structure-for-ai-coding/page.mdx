# Project Structure for AI-Assisted Development

The most effective way to leverage MCP (Model Context Protocol) is through the **Project Specification Template**. This structured approach helps AI understand your requirements and generate appropriate code for your smart contract project.

The template is available in the [Klever MCP GitHub repository](https://github.com/klever-io/mcp-klever-vm/blob/develop/docs/project-specification-template.md).

**Key Benefits:**
- Provides clear project structure and requirements
- Ensures consistent development approach
- Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated code
- Follows smart contract best practices

> **Note:** Always customize the template to match your specific project needs. The template uses a Dice Game contract as an example, which you can replace with your own project concept.

## How to Use the Template

### Basic Prompt Structure

To initialize a new project using the template, use this prompt format:

```text
Create a new Klever smart contract using the project specification template.

Project: [Your Project Name]
Requirements:
- [List your specific requirements]
- [Define functionality needed]
- [Include any constraints or special considerations]

Please follow the complete template workflow including Phase 0 knowledge discovery.
```

### Practical Example

Here's a complete example for a gaming contract:

```text
Create a new Klever smart contract using the project specification template.

Project: Decentralized Dice Game
Requirements:
- Players can bet KLV tokens on dice outcomes (1-6)
- Secure random number generation for each roll
- 5.88x payout multiplier with 2% house edge
- Betting limits: minimum 10 KLV, maximum 1000 KLV
- Administrative functions for profit withdrawal and game management
- Pause/resume functionality for maintenance

Please follow the complete template workflow including:
1. Phase 0: Blockchain fundamentals discovery using MCP queries
2. Knowledge documentation in knowledge-notes.md
3. Complete project initialization with automation scripts
4. Test scenarios and deployment preparation
```

## Template Components

### Phase 0: Knowledge Discovery

Before implementation begins, the template conducts comprehensive research:

- **Blockchain Fundamentals**: Query MCP for core Klever blockchain concepts
- **Token Systems**: Document KLV token mechanics and precision handling
- **Command Syntax**: Learn proper command structure and parameter usage
- **Event Limitations**: Understand event system constraints and workarounds
- **Best Practices**: Research proven storage patterns and security measures
- **Common Pitfalls**: Identify and document frequently encountered issues

## When to Use the Template

The Project Specification Template is ideal for:

- **Complex Contracts**: Multi-feature projects requiring systematic planning
- **Production Systems**: Applications needing robust architecture and testing
- **Learning Projects**: Following established best practices and patterns
- **Team Development**: Ensuring consistent approach across team members
