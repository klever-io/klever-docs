How to interact with testnet

To run an observer node or a validator on the testnet you can follow [all the same steps of the mainnet](/node-operations#how-to-run-a-node), just changing the docker image from `kleverapp/klever-go:latest` to `kleverapp/klever-go:latest-testnet` and the config files you can download from [https://backup.testnet.klever.org/config.testnet.109.tar.gz](https://backup.testnet.klever.org/config.testnet.109.tar.gz)

You can use the [Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.kleverscan.org/) to view and interact with all testnet features.

### Faucet

If you need money on testnet you can request a faucet in [Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.kleverscan.org/) wallet details (needs extension installed).
