# Transfer Flow

The Klever Bridge enables seamless cross-chain token transfers between Klever Blockchain and EVM-compatible blockchains (such as Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.). The transfer process is orchestrated by a network of relayers that follow a sophisticated state machine to ensure security, consensus, and finality across chains.

## How It Works

The bridge operates using a **relayer network** that monitors transactions on both chains and facilitates secure cross-chain transfers. When a user initiates a transfer, the relayers work together to:

1. **Monitor** pending transactions on the source chain
2. **Validate** and reach consensus on transfer requests
3. **Execute** transfers on the destination chain
4. **Confirm** transaction finality and update batch status

The process varies depending on the transfer direction, with each requiring different numbers of steps and validation mechanisms to ensure maximum security.

## Transfer Directions

Choose the documentation that matches your transfer direction:

### ðŸ“¤ EVM-Compatible Chain â†’ Klever Blockchain
Transfer tokens from Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, or other EVM chains to Klever Blockchain.
- **Mechanism**: Deposit ERC20 tokens â†’ Receive KDA tokens
- **[View EVMâ†’Klever Blockchain Transfer Flow](./transfer-flow/evm-kc)**

### ðŸ“¥ Klever Blockchain â†’ EVM-Compatible Chain  
Transfer tokens from Klever Blockchain to Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, or other EVM chains.
- **Mechanism**: Deposit KDA tokens â†’ Receive ERC20 tokens
- **[View Klever Blockchainâ†’EVM Transfer Flow](./transfer-flow/kc-evm)**

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Validation**: Minimum 7 out of 10 relayers must approve each transfer
- **Secure Asset Handling**: Tokens are locked/burned on source chain and minted/released on destination
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple transactions are processed together for efficiency
- **Cross-Chain Finality**: Complete confirmation on both chains before marking transfers complete
