# Klever Blockchain â†’ EVM-Compatible Chain

When transferring tokens from Klever Blockchain to an EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum), the process follows a more complex 10-step relayer state machine:

## User Interaction
**Token Deposit**
   - User deposits KDA tokens into the Safe contract on Klever Blockchain
   - The contract securely locks or burns the tokens depending on configuration

## Relayer State Machine Process

### Step 1: **GetPending**
- **Purpose**: Monitor pending transactions on Klever
- **Action**: Query the Safe smart contract on Klever Blockchain
- **Trigger**: Continues until transaction batch size reaches threshold
- **Result**: Batch is ready for processing

### Step 2: **SignProposedTransfer**
- **Purpose**: Initial signature collection
- **Action**: Each relayer signs the transaction independently
- **Distribution**: Relayers broadcast their signatures to other relayers
- **Result**: Signature collection begins

### Step 3: **WaitForQuorumOnTransfer**
- **Purpose**: Collect sufficient signatures
- **Action**: Relayers wait for remaining signatures from the network
- **Requirement**: Minimum signature threshold must be met
- **Result**: Enough signatures collected for transfer execution

### Step 4: **PerformTransfer**
- **Purpose**: Execute the cross-chain transfer
- **Action**: One relayer performs the actual transfer to Ethereum
- **Coordination**: Other relayers monitor the execution
- **Result**: Transfer transaction is submitted to Ethereum

### Step 5: **WaitTransferConfirmation**
- **Purpose**: Ensure transfer finality
- **Action**: Wait for Ethereum network confirmation of the transfer
- **Monitoring**: Relayers track transaction status on Ethereum
- **Result**: Transfer is confirmed on the destination chain

### Step 6: **ResolveSetStatus**
- **Purpose**: Verify transfer completion
- **Action**: Relayers retrieve and verify the transfer status confirmation
- **Validation**: Cross-reference transfer success on Ethereum
- **Result**: Transfer status is confirmed and verified

### Step 7: **ProposeSetStatus**
- **Purpose**: Initiate status update
- **Action**: Relayers propose changing the batch status in the Klever contract
- **Objective**: Mark the batch as successfully completed
- **Result**: Status change proposal is submitted

### Step 8: **SignProposedSetStatus**
- **Purpose**: Approve status change
- **Action**: Relayers sign the proposed status change
- **Validation**: Each relayer confirms the transfer was successful
- **Result**: Status change signatures are collected

### Step 9: **WaitForQuorumOnSetStatus**
- **Purpose**: Ensure consensus on status change
- **Action**: Wait for sufficient signatures on the status change
- **Requirement**: Quorum must be reached for status update
- **Result**: Consensus achieved for finalizing batch status

### Step 10: **PerformSetStatus**
- **Purpose**: Finalize the batch
- **Action**: Execute the status change in the Klever contract
- **Result**: Batch is marked as completed, process is finalized

### Final Delivery
**Token Issuance & Recipient Delivery**
   - On the EVM-compatible blockchain, the equivalent tokens are either:
     - Minted as wrapped tokens (for Klever-native assets)
     - Released from reserves (if already native to the EVM chain)
   - The destination address receives the equivalent amount of tokens (minus any applicable bridge fees)
