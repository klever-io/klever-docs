# EVM-Compatible Chain â†’ Klever Blockchain

When transferring tokens from an EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) to Klever Blockchain, the process follows the relayer state machine:

## User Interaction
**Token Deposit**
   - User deposits ERC20 tokens into the Safe contract on the EVM chain
   - The contract acts as a secure vault for the original tokens

## Relayer State Machine Process

### Step 1: **GetPending**
- **Purpose**: Monitor and collect pending transactions
- **Action**: Relayers query the Safe smart contract on Ethereum to detect pending transactions
- **Trigger**: Continues until the transaction batch reaches the predefined threshold
- **Result**: Batch is ready for cross-chain processing

### Step 2: **ProposeTransfer**
- **Purpose**: Initiate cross-chain transfer proposal
- **Action**: One relayer proposes the transfer on Klever Blockchain's multisig contract
- **Result**: Transfer proposal is submitted and awaits approval

### Step 3: **SignProposedTransfer**
- **Purpose**: Collect relayer approvals
- **Action**: Other relayers in the network sign and approve the proposed transfer
- **Requirement**: Each relayer validates the proposal before signing
- **Result**: Signatures are collected for consensus

### Step 4: **WaitForQuorumOnTransfer**
- **Purpose**: Ensure sufficient consensus
- **Action**: Relayers wait for the minimum required signatures (quorum)
- **Requirement**: Minimum of 7 out of 10 relayers must approve
- **Result**: Quorum is reached, enabling execution

### Step 5: **PerformActionID**
- **Purpose**: Execute the approved transfer
- **Action**: Call to the multisig contract to transfer tokens to destination accounts
- **Result**: Batch is marked as finished, tokens are delivered to recipients

## Final Delivery
**Token Issuance & Recipient Delivery**
   - On Klever Blockchain, the equivalent KDA tokens are either:
     - Minted (for wrapped representations of foreign tokens)
     - Released from reserves (for native Klever tokens)
   - The destination address receives the exact equivalent amount of KDA tokens
