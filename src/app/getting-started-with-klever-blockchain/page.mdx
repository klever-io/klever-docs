# Getting Started with Klever Blockchain

## Getting started with the Klever Blockchain is easy and straightforward.

Getting started with the Klever Blockchain is easy and straightforward. Here are the steps you need to take to start building and deploying decentralized applications on our platform:

1. Create an account: The first step is to create an account on the Klever Blockchain. You can do this by downloading the [Klever Wallet](https://klever.io/en-us), installing the[Klever Wallet Extension](https://klever.org/klever-extension/) on your Chrome browser, or using code to create an account. Be sure to keep your private key safe and secure. Make sure to create a backup to ensure the security of your account.

2. Fund your account: Once you have created your account, you will need to fund it with KLV, the native cryptocurrency of the Klever Blockchain. It is used to pay for bandwidth fees. The fees for various types of transactions on the blockchain are determined by an on-chain voting mechanism.

The following table lists the fees for different types of transactions on the Klever Blockchain:

| Transaction Type          | Fee (KLV)  |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Transfer                  | 0.5        |
| Create Asset              | 20,000     |
| Create Validator          | 50,000     |
| Validator Configuration   | 1,000      |
| Freeze                    | 1          |
| Unfreeze                  | 1          |
| Delegate                  | 1          |
| Undelegate                | 1          |
| Claim                     | 1          |
| Withdraw                  | 1          |
| Unjail                    | 10,000     |
| Vote                      | 1          |
| Buy/Sell                  | 1          |
| Config ITO                | 20,000     |
| Create Marketplace        | 50,000     |
| Config Marketplace        | 1,000      |
| Update account permission | 1,000      |
| Proposal                  | 500        |
| Set ITO price             | 1          |
| Cancel Market order       | 50         |
| Set account name          | 100        |

It's worth noting that fees on the blockchain can change depending on the on-chain voting mechanism, so the above table should be used as a rough guide only.

You can fund your [account](https://docs.klever.finance/getting-started-with-klever-blockchain/create-account) by purchasing KLV on a cryptocurrency exchange or by receiving it from another user. It is highly recommended to never leave your funds on an exchange and always withdraw to your own personal wallet.
