# Getting Started with Klever Blockchain

Getting started with the Klever Blockchain is easy and straightforward. Here are the steps you need to take to start building and deploying decentralized applications on our platform:

1. Create an address: The first step is to create an address on the Klever Blockchain. You can do this by downloading the [Klever Wallet](https://klever.io/en-us), installing the [Klever Wallet Extension](https://klever.org/klever-extension/) on your Chrome based browser, or using code to create an address. Be sure to keep your private key safe and secure. Make sure to create a backup to ensure the security of your address.

2. Fund your address: Once you have created your address, you will need to fund it with KLV, the native cryptocurrency of the Klever Blockchain. It is used to pay for bandwidth fees. The fees for various types of transactions on the blockchain are determined by an on-chain voting mechanism.

The following table lists the fees for different types of transactions on the Klever Blockchain:

| Transaction Type          | Fee (KLV)  |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Transfer                  | 0.5        |
| Create Asset              | 20,000     |
| Create Validator          | 50,000     |
| Validator Configuration   | 1,000      |
| Freeze                    | 1          |
| Unfreeze                  | 1          |
| Delegate                  | 1          |
| Undelegate                | 1          |
| Claim                     | 1          |
| Withdraw                  | 1          |
| Unjail                    | 10,000     |
| Vote                      | 1          |
| Buy/Sell                  | 1          |
| Config ITO                | 20,000     |
| Create Marketplace        | 50,000     |
| Config Marketplace        | 1,000      |
| Update account permission | 1,000      |
| Proposal                  | 500        |
| Set ITO price             | 1          |
| Cancel Market order       | 50         |
| Set account name          | 100        |

It's worth noting that fees on the blockchain can change depending on the on-chain voting mechanism, so the above table should be used as a rough guide only.

You can fund your [address](/getting-started-with-klever-blockchain#create-address) by purchasing KLV on a cryptocurrency exchange or by receiving it from another address. It is highly recommended to never leave your funds on an exchange and always withdraw to your own personal wallet.

  1. The Klever Wallet extension allows you to create and manage your wallet directly from your Chrome browser. Simply install the extension and follow the prompts to create your address.

3. You can also create an address on the Klever Blockchain by using code. You can use the Klever API or SDK to create an address and generate a private key. Please refer to our API documentation for more information on how to do this.

```javascript
//import the sdk
var sdk = require("@klever/sdk");

//create a new klever account for klv and kda tokens
var klvAccount = await sdk.utils.generateKeyPair()

//check your private key and address
console.log(klvAccount)
```

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@klever/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@klever/sdk)

Whichever method you choose, be sure to keep your private key safe and secure. Your private key is used to access and manage your address, so it is important to store it in a safe place and never share it with anyone.
