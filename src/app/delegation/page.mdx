# Delegation

Delegation operations

How to perform delegation on Klever Blockchain.

## How To Delegate To Others

Delegate to other validators

Delegate to an address [TO], pointing to the bucket [BUCKET_ID] where the frozen KLV is located.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd)/wallet:/opt/klever-blockchain \
    --network=host \
    --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/operator \
    kleverapp/klever-go:latest \
    --key-file=./walletKey.pem \
    --node=https://node.mainnet.klever.org \
    account delegate \
    klv186vg5k3pqetmfuy04620htcvz3krugu7hqe4ukczdy48r222j78q9y8vm5 \
    --bucketID=db0748c562c413a68b21a75249e1b936339fc03513e0bf076d3850b7a81113d2
```

It's important to know that there's a minimum self-staking amount for the validator. The structure for delegate command is:

[DELEGATE TO ADDRESS].

`[DELEGATE TO ADDRESS]` is the address you want to delegate the frozen bucket power (in this case your validator address)

`--bucketID` is the bucket hash, which can be found in the frozen TX ID or in Klever testnet explorer.

WIth the operator CLI, you can check the bucket ID with the command `tx-by-id` followed by the hash of the freeze transaction:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd)/wallet:/opt/klever-blockchain \
    --network=host \
    --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/operator \
    kleverapp/klever-go-testnet:latest \
    --key-file=./walletKey.pem \
    tx-by-id \

```

This process is the same of [Delegating frozen KLV to node](/become-a-validator#how-to-delegate-frozen-klv-to-node); however, here we choose who we want to delegate to.

To **redelegate**, you just need to keep the same Bucket ID and type a new address to whom the delegation will be done.



## How To Undelegate

Undelegate

To undelegate, you just need to specify the Bucket ID:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd)/wallet:/opt/klever-blockchain \
    --network=host \
    --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/operator \
    kleverapp/klever-go:latest \
    --key-file=./walletKey.pem \
    --node=https://node.mainnet.klever.org \
    account undelegate \
    --bucketID=db0748c562c413a68b21a75249e1b936339fc03513e0bf076d3850b7a81113d2
```
