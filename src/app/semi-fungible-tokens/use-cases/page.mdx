## Gaming & Virtual Worlds

### Game Items & In-Game Economies

**What It Solves**: Traditional gaming stores items in centralized databases—players don't truly own their assets. Deploying separate contracts for currencies (FT) and unique items (NFT) is expensive and complex.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Create multiple token IDs under one contract:
- **ID 1**: Gold coins (supply: unlimited, fungible)
- **ID 2**: Health potions (supply: 100,000, fungible within type)
- **ID 3**: Epic Sword v1 (supply: 500, all identical stats)
- **ID 4**: Epic Sword v2 (supply: 100, upgraded stats)
- **ID 5**: Legendary Dragon Blade (supply: 1, unique)

Each player's inventory becomes a single wallet holding multiple token IDs, enabling atomic trades ("3,000 gold + Epic Sword for your Legendary item").

**Klever Tips**:
- Use the `attributes` field in KDA to store stats on-chain
- Set royalties (e.g., 5%) to earn from secondary market trades
- Consider a KDA Fee Pool so players pay fees in your game token, not KLV

### Collectible Card Games / Digital Trading Cards

**What It Solves**: Physical card games struggle with authentication, scarcity enforcement, and secondary market tracking.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each card edition becomes a token ID:
- **ID 100**: "Fire Dragon – Common" (supply: 10,000)
- **ID 101**: "Fire Dragon – Rare Holographic" (supply: 500)
- **ID 102**: "Fire Dragon – Artist Signed Edition" (supply: 50)

**Business Model**:
- **Pack Sales**: Sell sealed packs as fungible SFTs; opening burns the pack and mints revealed cards
- **Guaranteed Rarity**: Smart contracts ensure pack contents match published odds
- **Creator Royalties**: Earn 5-10% on every secondary sale automatically

### Metaverse / Virtual World Assets

**How SFTs Work Here**:
- **ID 1**: "Blue Hoodie v1" (supply: 10,000, common wearable)
- **ID 2**: "Blue Hoodie v1 – Gold Trim" (supply: 500, rare variant)
- **ID 3**: "Land Parcel – Zone A" (supply: 100, standard plots)

**Interoperability Vision**: The same wearable SFT could theoretically render across multiple compatible metaverse platforms—you own the asset, not a license.

## Events & Access

### Event Tickets & Access Passes

**What It Solves**: Traditional tickets suffer from scalping, counterfeiting, and loss of value post-event.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each ticket category becomes a token ID:
- **ID 1**: "General Admission Day 1" (supply: 5,000)
- **ID 2**: "VIP Day 1" (supply: 500)
- **ID 3**: "Backstage Pass Day 1" (supply: 50)

**The SFT Lifecycle**:
1. **Pre-event**: All GA Day 1 tickets (same nonce) are fungible—swap yours for any other
2. **Check-in**: Scanning updates the token's metadata to "redeemed: true"
3. **Post-event**: Applications interpret redeemed tickets as collectibles (token type unchanged, metadata changed)

**Advanced Features**:
- **Anti-Scalping**: Set maximum resale price as percentage of original
- **Revenue Sharing**: Automatically split resale profits with venue/artist
- **Bundled Experiences**: Attach additional SFTs (meet-and-greet, merchandise credits)

**Klever Tips**: Use 4-second block finality for real-time gate scanning.

### Whitelists & Allowlist Tickets

**How SFTs Work Here**:
- **ID 1**: "Mint Pass – Phase 1" (supply: 500, max 3 NFTs each)
- **ID 2**: "Mint Pass – Phase 2" (supply: 2,000, max 2 NFTs each)
- **ID 3**: "Beta Tester Invitation" (supply: 100)

**Mechanics**:
- Holding the token grants the right
- Burning/redeeming exercises the right
- Unused passes can be traded on secondary markets

## Loyalty & Rewards

### Loyalty Points & Tiered Rewards

**What It Solves**: Traditional loyalty programs are siloed (can't transfer airline miles to hotel points), non-transparent, and easily manipulated.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each program/tier becomes a token ID:
- **ID 1**: "Brand X – Standard Points" (fungible within tier)
- **ID 2**: "Brand X – Gold Member Points" (2x value)
- **ID 3**: "Brand X – Platinum Points" (5x value)

**Innovative Possibilities**:
- **Cross-Brand Exchanges**: Partner with other brands for point swaps
- **Expiration Transparency**: Encode expiry dates; users can sell before losing value
- **Gamified Tiers**: Automatic tier upgrades based on token holdings

### Multi-Class Reward & Incentive Systems

**How SFTs Work Here**: Unified contract with multiple point types:
- **ID 1**: "Referral Points" (earned by bringing new users)
- **ID 2**: "Quest Points" (earned by completing tasks)
- **ID 3**: "Governance Points" (earned by DAO participation)
- **ID 4**: "Purchase Points" (earned from transactions)

**Advanced Mechanics**:
- **Cross-Type Exchanges**: 100 Quest Points = 50 Purchase Points
- **Multiplier Stacking**: Hold Gold Badge? 2x all point earnings
- **Leaderboards**: Query top holders across categories

### Achievements, Badges & Reputation

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each achievement is a token ID:
- **ID 100**: "Completed Python Fundamentals" (educational)
- **ID 101**: "100 Day Streak" (engagement)
- **ID 102**: "Community Helper – Gold" (reputation)
- **ID 103**: "Bug Hunter – Critical" (contribution)

Everyone who earns the same achievement receives the same token ID—creating a cohort that can be queried, rewarded, or targeted.

**Soulbound Considerations**: Many achievements should be non-transferable. Klever's permission system can enforce `canTransfer: false`.

## Commerce & Coupons

### Coupons, Vouchers & Gift Cards

**What It Solves**: Paper coupons are easily counterfeited; digital codes can be shared infinitely.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each promotion becomes a token ID:
- **ID 1**: "10% OFF – Spring 2026 Campaign" (supply: 50,000)
- **ID 2**: "$25 Gift Card – Holiday Edition" (supply: 10,000)
- **ID 3**: "Free Item – New Customer Welcome" (supply: 5,000)

**Post-Redemption Value**: Once redeemed, the coupon's metadata is updated (e.g., "redeemed: true") and serves as proof-of-purchase—valuable for warranty claims or brand engagement history. The token remains an SFT; applications interpret it differently based on its state.

**Klever Tips**: Mark tokens as "redeemed" via attribute update (not burn) to preserve history.

### Subscriptions & Time-Bound Passes

**How SFTs Work Here**:
- **ID 1**: "1-Month Basic Pass" (fungible, consumable)
- **ID 2**: "1-Month Premium Pass" (fungible, more features)
- **ID 3**: "Annual Basic Pass" (fungible, discounted rate)
- **ID 4**: "Lifetime Founder Pass" (limited supply, non-expiring)

**Innovative Models**:
- **Transferable Subscriptions**: Sell your remaining 6 months to another user
- **Rental Markets**: "Rent" a premium pass for 1 week at lower cost
- **Fractional Access**: Share a family plan via tokenized seats

### Phygital Goods & Product Authentication

**What It Solves**: Counterfeiting costs luxury brands billions annually. Physical certificates are easily forged.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each product line becomes a token ID:
- **ID 1**: "Designer Handbag – Model X, Black" (supply: 5,000)
- **ID 2**: "Designer Handbag – Model X, Limited Gold" (supply: 50)

The physical item contains an NFC chip or QR code linked to the specific token. Scanning verifies authenticity and displays ownership history.

**Applications Beyond Luxury**:
- **Warranties**: Token proves warranty validity, transfers with resale
- **Wine & Spirits**: Provenance tracking from vineyard to glass
- **Sneakers**: Authentication for resale market

## Finance & Ownership

### Limited-Edition Digital Collectibles

**What It Solves**: Creating 100 individual NFTs for an art edition is expensive. Editions should be fungible within the run but distinct from other editions.

**How SFTs Work Here**:
- **ID 1**: "Artwork Alpha – Edition of 100" (supply: 100, all identical)
- **ID 2**: "Artwork Alpha – Artist Proof" (supply: 10)
- **ID 3**: "Artwork Alpha – 1/1 Original" (supply: 1)

All 100 copies of Edition 1 are interchangeable—collectors don't care which specific copy they own, only that they own *one* from the edition.

**Klever Tips**: Use royalties aggressively (10-15%) since collectors expect creator compensation.

### Real-World Asset Units (Fractional Ownership)

**What It Solves**: High-value assets (real estate, art, commodities) are inaccessible to small investors.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each asset becomes a token ID with supply representing ownership units:
- **ID 1**: "123 Main St – Residential Property" (supply: 1,000 shares)
- **ID 2**: "Gold Bar #GLD-2025-001" (supply: 100 grams)
- **ID 3**: "Picasso Print – 'Le Rêve'" (supply: 100 shares)

All shares of ID 1 are fungible—you can swap your 5% for anyone else's 5%. But ID 1 is non-fungible against ID 2.

**Legal Considerations**: Tokens typically represent ownership in a legal entity (LLC/SPV), not direct property title. Requires securities compliance.

### Tiered Crowdfunding / Fundraising Perks

**How SFTs Work Here**:
- **ID 1**: "Bronze Backer" (supply: 1,000, basic rewards)
- **ID 2**: "Silver Backer" (supply: 500, enhanced rewards)
- **ID 3**: "Gold Backer" (supply: 100, premium rewards)
- **ID 4**: "Founding Patron" (supply: 10, exclusive access)

**Beyond Initial Funding**:
- **Ongoing Perks**: Gold Backers get perpetual discounts
- **Governance Rights**: Higher tiers have more DAO votes
- **Upgrade Paths**: Trade 3 Bronze for 1 Silver

### Intellectual Property & Royalty Rights

**How SFTs Work Here**: Fractional royalty ownership:
- **ID 1**: "Song X – Master Recording Rights" (supply: 1,000 shares)
- **ID 2**: "Song X – Publishing Rights" (supply: 1,000 shares)

Holding 10 shares of ID 1 entitles you to 1% of master recording royalties.

### DAO Governance & Voting Rights

**How SFTs Work Here**: Multiple governance token classes:
- **ID 1**: "Standard Voting Token" (1 token = 1 vote)
- **ID 2**: "Council Seat" (supply: 7, enhanced voting power)
- **ID 3**: "Proposal Creation Right" (supply: 100)
- **ID 4**: "Veto Power Token" (supply: 3, emergency use only)

**Advanced Governance**:
- **Time-Weighted Voting**: Longer holders get multiplied votes
- **Delegation**: Transfer voting power without transferring tokens
- **Quadratic Voting**: Implemented via smart contract logic

### Insurance & Risk Tokenization

**How SFTs Work Here**:
- **ID 1**: "Flight Delay Insurance – Route NYC-LAX" (parametric)
- **ID 2**: "Crop Insurance – Corn, Iowa 2025" (agricultural)
- **ID 3**: "DeFi Protocol Coverage – Lending Pool X" (crypto-native)

**Parametric Model**:
1. User purchases insurance SFT (pays premium)
2. Oracle monitors trigger conditions
3. If triggered, smart contract automatically pays out
4. No claims process, no human approval needed

## Supply Chain & Enterprise

### Batch-Based Supply Chain Tokens

**What It Solves**: Supply chain tracking relies on paper certificates and centralized databases—easily falsified, impossible to verify independently.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each production batch becomes a token ID:
- **ID 2025-A-001**: "Coffee Beans – Batch A, January 2025" (supply: 10,000 kg)
- **ID 2025-A-002**: "Coffee Beans – Batch B, January 2025" (supply: 8,500 kg)

All units within Batch A are fungible (any 1kg is equivalent), but Batch A is distinct from Batch B (different harvest dates, quality scores).

**Applications**:
- **Food & Beverage**: Wine vintages, olive oil harvests, specialty coffee
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Drug batches with expiration and recall capability
- **Luxury Goods**: Leather lots, gemstone parcels
- **Agriculture**: Grain lots, livestock cohorts

### Healthcare Records & Credentials

**How SFTs Work Here**:
- **ID 1**: "COVID-19 Vaccination Record" (patient-specific)
- **ID 2**: "Board Certification – Cardiology" (physician credential)
- **ID 3**: "Medical License – State of California" (provider credential)

**Privacy Considerations**:
- Store hashes, not raw personal data
- Use zero-knowledge proofs for verification
- Patient controls access via token permissions

### Carbon Credits & Environmental Assets

**What It Solves**: Carbon credit markets are opaque, prone to double-counting, and inaccessible to small participants.

**How SFTs Work Here**: Each verified carbon project becomes a token ID:
- **ID 1**: "Amazon Reforestation Project 2025" (supply: 100,000 tonnes)
- **ID 2**: "Solar Farm Kenya – Credits 2025" (supply: 50,000 tonnes)

All credits from the same project are fungible, but different projects are non-fungible (different verification standards, locations).

**Market Mechanics**:
- **Retirement**: Burning a credit permanently removes it from circulation
- **Fractional**: Own 0.5 tonnes for personal offsetting

## Summary

SFTs shine when you need:

- **Multiple asset types in one collection** - Gaming, loyalty, governance
- **Edition-based scarcity** - Collectibles, tickets, credentials
- **Metadata-driven state changes** - Pre-event to post-event, unused to redeemed
- **Batch efficiency** - Supply chain, bulk distributions
- **Fractional ownership** - Real estate, IP rights, carbon credits
- **Both "which type" and "how many"** - Track nonce + balance together
